This course provides an in-depth exploration of English lexicology and lexicography, examining key areas including word-formation processes, semantic analysis of word senses, and patterns of lexical innovation, variation and change. Grounded in authentic language data from dictionaries and corpora, students will develop analytical skills for studying lexis through dictionaries like the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and Wiktionary, and corpora such as BNC 2014 Spoken and COCA on the corpus platforms Sketch Engine and english-corpora.org. The programme emphasises practical experience in frequency analysis, collocation analysis, and Word Sketches through collaborative group projects, enabling students to use authentic data and empirical methods for lexicological research projects.
