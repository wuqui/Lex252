    "text": "Quote\n\n“What is most important, however, is that in lexicology the stock of words or lexical items is not simply regarded as a list of isolated elements. Lexicologists try to find out generalisations and regularities and especially consider relations between elements. Lexicology is therefore concerned with structures, not with a mere agglomeration of words.” (Lipka 1992: 1)\n\n\n\n00:45–01:00: Paraphrase. “Lexicology is not a ‘bag of words’. It looks for patterns: how words relate to each other (paradigmatic/syntagmatic) and how items are internally structured (morphology, senses).”\nKey takeaway: We study the lexicon as a system with structure, not isolated entries. This motivates methods like collocation analysis and word‑formation analysis.\nQuick prompt: “Name one relation between two words (synonym/antonym/hypernym) and one natural collocation.”\nBridge: “Next we move from this principle to concrete structures: paradigmatic vs syntagmatic, and how they appear in real data.”"
