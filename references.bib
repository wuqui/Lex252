  title = {An {{Introduction}} to {{English Lexicology}}},
  author = {Bauer, Laurie},
  date = {2022},
  publisher = {Edinburgh University Press},
  abstract = {A linguistic introduction to the structures and meanings of English words Lexicology is about words, their meanings and the relationships between them, their origins and their structure. It combines the study of derivational morphology with lexical semantics. This textbook explores the history, meanings and structure of words, the way they are collected in dictionaries and the way they are stored in our minds. It goes beyond examining the morphological structure of words to examine the way words are spelt and the way they sound. At every stage, the book focuses not only on description, but also on the puzzles that words present. Supported by numerous examples, exercises, discussion questions, suggestions for further reading and a glossary, this is an accessible and lively guide to the linguistic study of English through the consideration of words. Key Features: -Covers orthography, synonyms, hyponyms, figurative language, semantic analysis, loan words and dictionaries -Considers the history and morphological structure of English and the influence of borrowing from French, Latin and Greek -Includes examples, exercises and discussion questions in each chapter -Includes a glossary of key terms and suggestions for further reading Laurie Bauer is Emeritus Professor of Linguistics at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper uses corpus data and methods of distributional semantics in order to study English clippings such as dorm (< dormitory), memo (< memorandum), or quake (< earthquake). We investigate whether systematic meaning differences between clippings and their source words can be detected. The analysis is based on a sample of 50 English clippings. Each of the clippings is represented by a concordance of 100 examples in context that were gathered from the Corpus of Contemporary American English. We compare clippings and their source words both at the aggregate level and in terms of comparisons between individual clippings and their source words. The data show that clippings tend to be used in contexts that represent involved text production, which aligns with the idea that clipped words signal familiarity with their referents. It is further observed that individual clippings and their source words partly diverge in their distributional profiles, reflecting both overlap and differences with regard to their meanings. We interpret these findings against the theoretical background of Construction Grammar and specifically the Principle of No Synonymy.},
