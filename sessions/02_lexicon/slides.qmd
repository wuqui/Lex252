# Criteria for wordness

::: {.notes}
- 10:35–10:44
:::

## Utterance criterion

> "A word is the smallest unit which can stand on its own as an utterance." [@Bauer2022Introduction: 1]

. . .

- but: mentioning vs use

A: Is it *inadvisable* or *unadvisable*?

B: Un.

- grammatical words as utterances (e.g. *the*) only in special contexts

---

## Phonological criterion

> "A word [in isolation] has a single intonational focus point, or movement of pitch." [@Bauer2022Introduction: 2]

. . .

- but: sequencing and alternatives affect prosody
    - *in the beginning* vs *first* vs *forever* vs *for ever*
- minimal pair in intonation: *record* (N) vs *record* (V) in isolation vs context

Examples:

- *He will reˈcord the song.* / *He bought the ˈrecord.*

---

## Semantic criterion

> "A word has a single, unitary meaning." [@Bauer2022Introduction: 2]

. . .

but: near-synonymous expressions can differ in meaning

*finally* vs *in the end* (closure vs narrative sequencing)

Examples:

- *We finally arrived after midnight.* / *In the end, we stayed home.*

---

## Orthographic criterion

> "words are unitary orthographic units" [@Bauer2022Introduction: 2]

. . .

- but: spacing and hyphenation vary
    - *coffee pot* vs *coffee-pot*
    - *in so far as* vs *in‑so‑far‑as*
- diachronic change: *all right* vs *alright* (usage note in OED)

Examples:

- *It's all right.* / *It's alright.* (nonstandard in some styles).

---

## Dictionary criterion

> "A word is listed in the dictionary." [@Bauer2022Introduction: 2]

. . .

but: circularity; sub‑lexical units are also listed (e.g. prefix *un‑*)


## Practical definition

> "We will accept the spelling conventions of English as defining words […] which has the advantage of being practical." [@Bauer2022Introduction: 3]

## Criteria cheat sheet

| Criterion    | Diagnostic           | Quick example                      |
| :----------- | :------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Utterance    | standalone?          | *Un.* (context-dependent)          |
| Phonology    | stress pattern?      | *first* vs *for ever*              |
| Semantic     | unitary meaning?     | *finally* vs *in the end*          |
| Orthography  | spacing/hyphens?     | *alright* vs *all right*           |
| Dictionary   | listed?              | *un-* (sub-lexical but listed)     |

---

## Check: is this a word?

*alright*

. . .

::::: {.content-visible when-meta="params.show_solutions"}
→ orthographic controversy; cf. practical definition (accept spelling conventions)
:::::

*honeybee* vs *honey bee*

. . .

::::: {.content-visible when-meta="params.show_solutions"}
→ orthographic criterion; both attested; check dictionary practice
:::::

::: {.notes}
- 10:44–10:45
- Evidence task (60s): look up headword, check usage/orthography note, cite one example
:::

# Problems in delineating the term *word*

## Names

. . .

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
- names have unique reference; they pattern differently from common nouns
- examples:
    - *the Samantha*
    - *This isn't the Paris I remember.* (common‑noun use; compare corpus: "This isn't the Paris of my youth")
- roles as noun phrases (no modifiers): *the former Argentine*

## Multi-word expressions (MWE)

- compounds: *blackbird*, *coffee pot*
- phrasal verbs: *look up*, *take off*
- collocations: *strong tea*, *make a decision*
- idioms & proverbs: *kick the bucket*, *Too many cooks spoil the broth*

---

## Compounds

- *passion flower*; *sunflower*; *wall‑flower*
- onomasiological competition: *honey bee* vs *honeybee*

---

### Worked example: honey bee vs honeybee

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
- both forms occur; dictionaries may list one as headword with variant
- evidence to check:
    - headword spelling
    - variant forms list
    - example citations
- OED finding: *honeybee* (primary); *honey bee* (variant)

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Historical precedence | separate words older |
| Current usage | both forms common |
:::


## Phrasal verbs

- *He passed out.*  
- *He fainted.*

Examples:

- *She looked up the word.* / *She looked the word up.*


## Collocations

Continuum:

- **strong**: *kith and kin*
- **intermediate**: *all things considered*; *as a matter of fact*; *excuse me*; *good afternoon*; *I'm sorry to say*; *in other words*; *in the long run*
- **weak**: function‑word sequences like *in the*

Examples:

- *take a quick photo* (typical) vs *make a quick photo* (less typical)

---

### Worked example: collocation strength

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
- cues for strength:
    - fixedness
    - semantic transparency
    - paradigmatic alternatives

| Phrase | Typical? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| take a photo | yes | conventional light verb |
| make a photo | variable | regional/genre variation |
| do a photo | rare | atypical in standard usage |
:::

---

## Idioms & proverbs

- **Idioms**: *He kicked the bucket.* (= He died)
- **Proverbs**: *Too many cooks spoil the broth.* (fixed formulaic)

Examples:

- *She spilled the beans.* (= revealed the secret)
- *A stitch in time saves nine.* (cannot reorder)


## Worked example: ambiguous case

::: {.small}
*break down*

Form test:

::: {.fragment}
- written as two words → phrasal verb
:::

Stress test:

::: {.fragment}
- stress on particle *down* → phrasal verb
:::

Meaning test:

::: {.fragment}
- can be literal (*car broke down*) or figurative (*negotiations broke down*) → both possible
:::

Conclusion:

::: {.fragment}
- primarily phrasal verb; can form compound noun *breakdown*
:::
:::


## Check: Classifying multi-word expressions

*take a photo*

. . .

:::: {.content-visible when-meta="params.show_solutions"}
→ collocation (light verb construction)
::::

*kick the bucket*

. . .

:::: {.content-visible when-meta="params.show_solutions"}
→ idiom (non-compositional)
::::

### Inflectional paradigms

> "The term 'paradigm' is in general usage, but its usage is often limited. Although *paradigm* can justifiably be used of any substitution class, it is most often used of substitution classes within the word. Thus the normal use for the term *paradigm* is the kind of substitution class illustrated in the following example." [@Bauer2022Introduction]

> \(12\): *walk*, *walks*, *walked*, *walking*

This paradigm illustrates two different kinds of word: there is a sense in which all the items are different **word-forms**, and a contrasting sense in which the paradigm illustrates different uses of the same word, the **lexeme**."

---

### Derivational paradigms

\(13\)

|                | *deceive*   | *employ*     | *proceed*    | *theorise*     |
|:--------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| **Verb**       | *deceive*   | *employ*     | *proceed*    | *theorise*     |
| **Noun**       | *deception* | *employer*   | *process*    | *theory*       |
| **Adjective**  | *deceptive* | *employable* | *processual* | *theoretical*  |

Although these examples show individual word families, these series are often generalised over several word families (e.g. *theory* – *theorist* – *theorise* parallels *fantasy* – *fantasist* – *fantasise*).

---

### Inflection vs Derivation: key contrast

| Type | Same lexeme? | Word class change? | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inflection** | yes | no | WALK → *walks*, *walked*, *walking* |
| **Derivation** | no (new lexeme) | often | EMPLOY → *employer* (N), *employable* (Adj) |

---

### Visual family tree: derivation

```
                      EMPLOY (V)
                    /     |      \
                   /      |       \
            employer  employable  employment
              (N)       (Adj)       (N)
```

---

### Check: Paradigms

::: {.small}
1. Identify all inflected forms for the lexeme *walk*^v^

::: {.fragment}
::: {.content-visible when-meta="params.show_solutions"}
- *walks*: 3rd person present 
- *walking*: present participle
- *walked*: past tense 
- *walked*: past participle
:::
:::

2. Find as many derived forms as possible for the base X

::: {.fragment}
::: {.content-visible when-meta="params.show_solutions"}
- N: *theorist*, *theoretician*, *theoretics*, *theorisation*
- Adj: *theoretical*, *theoretic*
- Adv: *theoretically*
- V: *theorise*
    - also AmE: *theorize*, *theorization*, *theorizer*

# Practice: Using the OED — Topic & Objective

::: {.notes}
- 11:12–11:14
:::

- Topic: Using dictionary data to examine lexical structure and usage.
- Objective: Identify and describe "problematic" lexical cases via OED evidence.

---

### Navigation targets (OED)

- Forms/Spelling (variants)
- Phrasal verbs / Idioms sections
- Examples/Citations pane

---

### Tasks

::: {.notes}
- 11:15–11:45
:::

**Starter headwords** (choose one or explore all):

- *alright* (spelling variant)
- *kick the bucket* (idiom)
- *honeybee* (compound with variants)

**What to look for:**

- **Task A** (find two problematic cases): variant spellings? usage labels? date range in citations?
- **Task B** (compare entries): entry structure? cross-references? examples?
- **Task C** (extract citations & discuss): fixedness cues? semantic transparency? paradigmatic alternatives?
