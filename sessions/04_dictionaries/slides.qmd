# Introduction

## Recap

- Morphology vs word‑formation: structure of words vs processes that create new lexemes
- Inflection vs derivation: grammatical endings (e.g., *walked*, *cats*) vs new lexemes/word classes (e.g., *kindness*, *happiness*)
- Morphemic vs non‑morphemic word‑formation: derivation/compounding vs conversion, clipping, blending, back‑formation, acronyms
- Takeaway: we reasoned about words via relations and structure — not mere lists; today we link this perspective to how dictionaries model lexis

# The Lexicon

## Two senses of *lexicon*

@Lipka1992OutlineEnglish, p. 11

"In the following, I will use *lexicon* in two senses that are not always sharply distinguished:  

a) for a **metalinguistic level**, or a sub-component in a linguistic model; and  
b) in the **sense of vocabulary** as seen from a systematic, synchronic point of view."  

---

### Key ideas — Two senses of lexicon

- Metalinguistic component in a linguistic model (place in a theory)
- Vocabulary of a language/community (items and their relations)
- Ambiguity in usage — clarify which sense is meant in context

::: {.notes}
- 10:19–10:21
:::


## Objective of lexicology

- “What is most important, however, is that in lexicology the stock of words or lexical items is not simply regarded as a **list of isolated elements**.  
- Lexicologists try to find out **generalisations** and **regularities** and especially consider **relations** between elements (see chapters n and IV).  
- Lexicology is therefore concerned with **structures**, not with a mere agglomeration of words (cf. @Jackson1988WordsTheir: 222)."  
  [@Lipka1992OutlineEnglish, p. 1]

---

### Key ideas — Objective of lexicology

- Move beyond lists: explain items via patterns and relations
- Focus on structures (paradigmatic/syntagmatic) and generalisations
- Aim: connect evidence to theory and make predictions

### List vs structure — quick examples

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
- List view: “Words in English cooking”  
  - *butter*, *salt*, *pepper*, *pan*, *fry*
- Structure view (relations):  
  - collocation: *strong tea* vs. ?*powerful tea*  
  - substitution: *cat* → *dog* (same slot), *fry* → *sauté* (near-synonym)
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}
Contrasts to discuss:

- strong vs. powerful (collocation)
- *cat* vs. *dog* (paradigmatic slot)
- *fry* vs. *sauté* (near-synonym proximity)

## Definition [@Bauer2022Introduction]

- “The lexicon is what linguists call the dictionary that is assumed to be **in people's heads**, or the linguist's best approximation to that.  
- It is fundamentally a *psychological entity*, and its contents cannot be observed directly but must be deduced from speakers' and hearers' **behaviour**.  
- Two fundamental approaches:  
  1. **Home of the lawless** [@DiSciullo1987Definition] – lexicon contains whatever cannot be predicted by general rule.  
  2. Wider approach – lexicon contains anything to do with the **structure of words**, whether lawless or not."

## The mental lexicon

---

### Evidence for a mental lexicon

- Slips and blends; priming effects; Stroop interference 
  - e.g., *RED* printed in blue slows colour naming
- Reaction-time studies (lexical decision, frequency effects)
  - e.g., faster decisions for frequent *time* than rare *murrain*
- Network structure: degree, clustering, multiplex links
  - e.g., *dog* linked to *cat* (semantic) and *log* (phonological)

### Embeddings — caveats and use

- Capture distributional similarity (usage-based); not “meaning equals vectors”
- Sensitive to training data/bias; opaque dimensions
- Best for intuition-building and retrieval; not a ground truth

### Freudian slip [@Bauer2022Introduction]

"If you talk to someone about electricity, and then make them read the phrase *sham dock*, they might very well say *damn shock*, because of prior activation of related words; the Freudian slip depends upon a subject area being readily activated in the brain and brought out inadvertently, whether because of a word related in meaning or pronunciation."


# Dictionaries [@Bauer2022Introduction]

## What is a *word*?

- "A word is listed in the dictionary." [@Bauer2022Introduction, p. 2]
  But:  
  - circular reasoning – words are listed *because* they are words  
  - dictionaries also list smaller units (e.g. prefix *un-*)
- "[...] in general we will accept the spelling conventions of English as defining words. This may not be terribly scientific, but it has the advantage of being practical." [@Bauer2022Introduction, p. 3]


## Definition of *dictionary*

- "The term *dictionary* is usually restricted to real-world dictionaries that appear in print and online.
- Dictionaries provide a list of words of whatever language they deal with – in our case, English – and then give a certain amount of information about each of them.
- They tend to have two functions, which may at times conflict:
  1. **Describe** the language as it is (descriptive)  
  2. Provide an influence for establishing and maintaining the **standard** form of the language (prescriptive)"

---

## From data to dictionary entries

- Corpus evidence → candidate headwords and senses
- Sense discrimination from usage patterns
- Definition writing and usage labels (register, region, style)
- Attested examples and cross‑references (derivatives, phraseology)

::: {.notes}
- 10:19–10:23
:::

---

## How are definitions written?

- Genus–differentia vs paraphrase
- Controlled defining vocabulary in learner’s dictionaries
- Clarity vs coverage: trade‑offs

### Check: propose a defining strategy (justify; then rewrite)

1. A bird category term (e.g., “raptor”) for non‑experts  
2. “Platform” (as used in social media contexts)  
3. “Set” (noun) — one common sense for beginners

Tasks:
- Choose strategy (genus–differentia or paraphrase) and justify with intended user.
- Rewrite the definition using a controlled defining vocabulary (learner’s style).

::: {.notes}
- 10:23–10:27
:::

---

## Ordering senses

- Chronological (OED) vs prototypical/frequency‑first (learner’s)
- Impact on user tasks (history vs learning)
- Criteria: earliest attested vs most typical/current; user intent matters

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
**Example: *tablet***  

- OED (historical principle): ‘slab/stone or clay for writing; pill’ → later ‘flat touchscreen computer’  
- Learner’s (prototype/frequency): foregrounds ‘flat touchscreen computer’ for modern users
::::
:::: {.column width="50%"}
**Consequences**

- Chronology helps trace change and citations.
- Prototype helps comprehension and production.

::: {.notes}
- 10:27–10:31

## Usage labels

Purpose: guide choices, not police usage

- Typical labels with examples:
  - **region**: *lorry* — chiefly BrE; *soccer* — chiefly AmE
  - **register**: *ain’t* — informal; *request* vs *ask* — formal vs neutral
  - **field**: *suture* — medical; *lemma* — linguistics
  - **stance**: pejorative/derogatory flags where appropriate

Principles: base on attested use; avoid over‑labelling; use neutral wording in definitions.

---

### Check: propose appropriate labels (justify with evidence)

- *sick* (‘excellent’) — labels? _______  (region/register/stance?)
- *they* (singular for a specific person) — labels? _______  (usage note?)
- *data* as a singular mass noun — labels? _______  (field/register?)
- *woke* (adjective, politicised) — labels? _______  (stance/region?)
- *soccer* in UK newspapers — labels? _______  (region/chronology?)


::: {.notes}
- 10:30–10:34
:::

---

## Phraseology in entries

- Collocations (*strong tea*, *heavy rain*), patterns (V + *decision*)
- MWEs: idioms, phrasal verbs, compounds

### Which is the “better” collocate?
  
1. *heavy/strong rain*
2. *deeply/strongly held belief*
3. *do/make research*
4. *commit/make a crime*
5. *take/make a decision*

::: {.notes}
- 10:34–10:38
:::


## Why examples matter

- Citations justify senses and usage labels
- Curated vs auto‑extracted: precision vs coverage
- Bias: genres, time periods, contributor communities
  - e.g., pre‑2000 slang under‑represented in print‑heavy sources → missing senses
  - e.g., BrE vs AmE: American news sources over‑represent “make a decision” vs BrE “take a decision”
  - e.g., field bias: biomedical corpora inflate plural “data are” vs general usage “data is”

- 10:43–10:45

### Descriptivism vs prescriptivism

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
@Bauer2022Introduction: 18

- "If we assume that one of *'kilometre* and *ki'lometre* is right (and the other therefore wrong), we assume that there is a **unique solution** to this question of English usage …"
- Language questions are more often like the *jeans* question (multiple acceptable answers) than like the *drive-on-the-right* question (single legal answer).

## Proof of the existence of words

“First of all, dictionaries provide evidence of the existence of a word.  The fact that a word is listed in a dictionary at all is taken to prove that there is such a word.  This can be misleading in two ways:

1. Dictionaries **sometimes list erroneous words** that have no existence outside the dictionary (e.g. *banket*, *sardel*).  
2. Dictionaries more often **fail to list perfectly good words** – no dictionary can list every word of English.”

# Studying word-formation based on empirical data using the OED

::: {.notes}
- AFTER BREAK — resume at 11:05

## Research questions

1. Which neologisms have entered the OED since 2000?
2. What are the most common word classes among these recent neologisms?
3. What are the most common word-formation processes?
4. Which semantic domains are most common?
5. Since when have these neologisms been in use?


## Extracting neologisms from the OED {.small}

Using OED’s Advanced Search functionality, we can extract neologisms – words that have only been used since the year 2000 – from the OED.

### Data preparation

1. Open a blank Excel sheet.
2. Click `import` and `CSV file`.
3. Select file origin encoding to `Unicode (UTF-8)`.
3. Specify that the data are **delimited by commas** (`csv`) as column separator.
4. Convert the region containing the data to a `Table`.
5. Insert one `Pivot Table` (and `Pivot Chart`) for each research question.
