# Studying word-formation based on empirical data using the OED

## Research questions

1. Which neologisms have entered the OED since 2000?
2. What are the most common word classes among these recent neologisms?
3. What are the most common word-formation processes?
4. Which semantic domains are most common?
5. Since when have these neologisms been in use?


## Extracting neologisms from the OED {.small}

Using OED’s Advanced Search functionality, we can extract neologisms – words that have only been used since the year 2000 – from the OED.

![[Search URL](https://www.oed.com/search/advanced/Entries?textTermOpt0=WordPhrase&dateOfUseFirstUse=true&dateOfUseFrom=2000&page=1&sortOption=Frequency)](att/oed-advanced-search.png)

## Analyzing the data in Microsoft Excel

### Data preparation

1. Open a blank Excel sheet.
2. Click `import` and `CSV file`.
3. Select file origin encoding to `Unicode (UTF-8)`.
3. Specify that the data are **delimited by commas** (`csv`) as column separator.
4. Convert the region containing the data to a `Table`.
5. Insert one `Pivot Table` (and `Pivot Chart`) for each research question.
